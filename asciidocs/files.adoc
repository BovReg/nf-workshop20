There are several ways to write and edit files.
The most commonly used text editors are `vi`, `emacs` and `gedit`.

// end::intro[]

// tag::gedit[]
== Gedit

Gedit is a text editor with graphical user interface. To create a new file in the current folder just call `gedit` with the name of the file:

[source,bash]
----
gedit file.txt
----

When you are done, save the file (by pressing kbd:[Ctrl+S] or by selecting menu:File[Save]) and close Gedit.
// end::gedit[]

// tag::vim[]
== Vi

Vi is a text editor with a command mode interface. See {vim-beginners-guide}[this article^] for a beginner's guide.

To create a new file in the current folder just call `vi` with the name of the file:

[source,bash]
----
vi file.txt
----

Vi has several modes which are specified in the bottom part of screen.
When you just open the editor you cannot write on the file, because it is the command mode.
To start writing, press kbd:[i], and you will notice that the status in the bottom of the screen changed to `INSERT`.
Now you can paste the text by right-click with the mouse and paste, or by pressing kbd:[SHIFT+Insert].
To go back to command mode press kbd:[ESC].
To save, make sure you are in command mode and type:

[source,vim]
----
:wq
----

To undo, press kbd:[u] when you are in command mode.
