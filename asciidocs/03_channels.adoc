= Channels

Channels are a key data structure of Nextflow that allows the implementation of reactive-functional oriented computational 
workflows based on the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming[Dataflow] programming paradigm.

They are used to logically connect tasks each other or to implement functional style data transformations.

== Channel types

Nextflow distinguish two different kinds of channels: *queue* channels and *value* channels.

=== Queue channel

A queue channel is a asynchronous unidirectional https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)[FIFO] 
queue which connects two processes or operators.

[square]
* What asynchronous means? That operations are non-blocking.

* What unidirectional means? That data flow from a producer to a consumer.

* What FIFO means? That the data is guaranteed to be delivered in the same order as it is produced.

A queue channel is implicitly created by process output definitions or using channel factories methods 
such as https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#from[Channel.from] or https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#frompath[Channel.fromPath].

Try the following snippets:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
ch = Channel.from(1,2,3)
println(ch)     <1>
ch.view()       <2>
----
<1> Use the built-in println function to print the ch variable.
<2> Apply the view method to the ch channel, therefore prints each item emitted by the channels.

==== Exercise

Try to execute this snippet, it will produce an error message.

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
p = Channel.from(1,2,3)
p.println()
p.println()
----

IMPORTANT: A queue channel can have one and exactly one producer and one and exactly one consumer. 

=== Value channels

A *value* channel a.k.a. singleton channel by definition is bound to a single value and it can be read unlimited times without consuming its content.

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
ch = Channel.value('Hello')
ch.view()
ch.view()
ch.view()
----

It prints: 

```
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

== Channel factories 


=== value

The `value` factory method is used to create a _value_ channel. An optional not ``null`` argument
can be specified to bind the channel to a specific value. For example:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
ch1 = Channel.value()                 // <1>
ch2 = Channel.value( 'Hello there' )  // <2>
ch2 = Channel.value( [1,2,3,4,5] )    // <3>
----

<1> Creates an _empty_ value channel. 
<2> Creates a value channel and binds a string to it.
<3> Creates a value channel and binds a list object to it that will be emitted as a sole emission.

=== from 

The factory `Channel.from` allows the creation of a queue channel with the values specified as argument. 

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
ch = Channel.from( 1, 3, 5, 7 )
ch.println{ "value: $it" }
----

The first line in this example creates a variable `ch` which holds a channel object. This channel emits the values specified as a parameter in the `from` method. Thus the second line will print the following:

----
value: 1
value: 3
value: 5
value: 7
----

=== of

The method `Channel.of` works in a similar manner to `Channel.from`, though it fixes some inconsistent behavior of the latter and provides a better handling for range of values. For example:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
    .of(1..23, 'X', 'Y')
    .view()
----

=== fromList

The method `Channel.fromList` creates a channel emitting the elements provided by a list objects specified as argument:

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
list = ['hello', 'world']

Channel
    .fromList(list)
    .view()
----

=== fromPath

The `fromPath` factory method create a queue channel emitting one or more files 
matching the specified glob pattern. 

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel.fromPath( '/data/big/*.txt' )
----

This example creates a channel and emits as many items as there are files with `txt` extension in the `/data/big` folder. Each element is a file object implementing the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Paths.html[Path] interface.  

TIP: Two asterisks, i.e. `\**`, works like `*` but crosses directory boundaries. This syntax is generally used for matching complete paths. Curly brackets specify a collection of sub-patterns.


.Available options 
[%header,cols="15%,85%"] 
|===
|Name
|Description

|glob
|When ``true`` interprets characters ``*``, ``?``, ``[]`` and ``{}`` as glob wildcards, otherwise handles them as normal characters (default: ``true``)

|type
| Type of paths returned, either ``file``, ``dir`` or ``any`` (default: ``file``)

|hidden
| When ``true`` includes hidden files in the resulting paths (default: ``false``)

|maxDepth
| Maximum number of directory levels to visit (default: `no limit`)

|followLinks
| When ``true`` it follows symbolic links during directories tree traversal, otherwise they are managed as files (default: ``true``)

|relative
| When ``true`` returned paths are relative to the top-most common directory (default: ``false``)

|checkIfExists
| When ``true`` throws an exception of the specified path do not exist in the file system (default: ``false``)
|===

Learn more about the blog pattern syntax at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob[this link].

==== Exercise 

Use the `Channel.fromPath` method to create a channel emitting all files with the suffix `.fq` in the `data/ggal/` and any subdirectory, then print the file name.


=== fromFilePairs

The `fromFilePairs` method creates a channel emitting the file pairs matching a glob pattern provided by the user. The matching files are emitted as tuples in which the first element is the grouping key of the matching pair and the second element is the list of files (sorted in lexicographical order).

[source,nextflow,linenums]
----
Channel
    .fromFilePairs('/my/data/SRR*_{1,2}.fastq')
    .println()
----

It will produce an output similar to the following:

```
[SRR493366, [/my/data/SRR493366_1.fastq, /my/data/SRR493366_2.fastq]]
[SRR493367, [/my/data/SRR493367_1.fastq, /my/data/SRR493367_2.fastq]]
[SRR493368, [/my/data/SRR493368_1.fastq, /my/data/SRR493368_2.fastq]]
[SRR493369, [/my/data/SRR493369_1.fastq, /my/data/SRR493369_2.fastq]]
[SRR493370, [/my/data/SRR493370_1.fastq, /my/data/SRR493370_2.fastq]]
[SRR493371, [/my/data/SRR493371_1.fastq, /my/data/SRR493371_2.fastq]]
```

IMPORTANT: The glob pattern must contain at least a star wildcard character.

==== Exercise 

Use the `fromFilePairs` method to create a channel emitting all pairs of fastq read in the `data/ggal/` 
directory and print them. 

Then use the `flat:true` option and compare the output with the previous execution.
